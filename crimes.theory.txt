approximately 1 week per level
although 2nd level will be introduced very early

that means, per level, one crime that takes approx 3 days to get 50% of way there
also crime that takes ~1 min and gets ~1%


3 days 50%
1 min 1%
1 hr 10%

this way people could lazily get there in a week, but if was keen could get there earilier

every other crime won't really give much noto, well, that won't be their purpose
